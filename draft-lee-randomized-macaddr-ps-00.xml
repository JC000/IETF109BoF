   <abstract>
      <t>MAC address is the Link Layer address used in the Ethrenet protocol.
        It is usually assigned by the Network Interface Card manufacturer and being used
        for forwording and receiving frame. Due to the static nature of the
        MAC address, it raises some privacy concerns and MAC address randomization
        is being implemented. This draft documents the impacts of MAC address
        randomization to existing use cases and proposes few next steps IETF may
        consider to work on.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Ethernet protocol
        is the implementation of data link layer defined in the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI).
        Ethernet protocol is defined in IEEE 802.1 standard and MAC address is the address used in Ethernet protocol.
        MAC address is 48-bit long
        and usually defined in the hardware. Each Ethernet interface comes
        with a MAC address assigned by the manufacturer. Each device has one or more
        MAC addresses. For example, a given IoT device may only have a single WiiFi
        network interface and therefore a single MAC address. In contract, a
        laptop may have three interfaces that encompasses two wired Ethernet ports
        and a WiFi interface, and therefore will have three MAC addresses.
        MAC address is used at
        the Local-Area-Network (LAN) for frame forwarding. It is locally
        significant in the LAN and critical LAN-to-LAN
        communications.</t>

        <t>The device manufacturer typically assigns the MAC address to an interface.
        Unless the user or operating system modifies the MAC address, which is
        sometimes the case, the MAC address follows a defined format and uses 2 parts.
        Those are Manufacturer ID and Interface ID. In a typical MAC address,
        the first 3 bytes correspond to the organization that created the device,
        called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This OUI portion
        uniquely identifies a manufacturer, vendor, or other organization, and
        is assigned by the IEEE from their IEEE Registration Authority.
        The second 3 bytes of the MAC address, the Network Interface Controller
        (NIC) portion, is an identifier assigned by the manufacturer (or whatever
        organization was assigned the OUI). Because of how MAC addresses are
        constructed, a MAC address may contain information from which an
        actor/service on a local network can infer the type and/or manufacturer
        of the device, which is useful for a variety of operational and
        troubleshooting reasons. For example, a MAC address can be used to
        determine to which device on a LAN to permit or deny access at a
        particular time of day (e.g. child's tablet may not access Internet
        after 22:00 hrs until 06:00 hrs). Such services often rely on a database
        or other method to map MAC addreses to a likely device make and model,
        such as using a commercial service from Fingerbank,
        https://fingerbank.org/about/, after which the user would then label
        the device (e.g. Janeâ€™s iPhone).</t>

        <t>Many networks today
        use MAC address to uniquely identify a device. For example: Sticky DHCP
        assignment often maps to MAC address. In additional, many local network
        policies such as port-forwarding, DMZ setup and LAN QoS are all based on
        MAC address. There are also business policies that are making
        assumptions on MAC address. For example: Hospitality Internet service
        used in hotels, airplanes, and Community WiFi often uses MAC address to
        tie to Internet subscription.</t>

        <t>Major operating systems have implemented and deployed MAC address randomization
        to improve device and user privacy. It is common practice on many types of networks
        today to use the  MAC address as a form of device identification. This practice will
        break some applications and policies at the IP layer and Transport layer. We are interested
        in determining if there is sufficient support in the IETF community to define
        best practices and potentially a new protocol for service continuity in the
        presence of MAC address randomization.</t>

      <name>Problem Statement</name>

        <t>Recently, privacy concerns have been raised related to persistent (static) MAC Addresses (refs needed). In 
		particular, the privacy security communities worry about the risks associated with being able to 
		associate a MAC Address to a particular device and/or person (refs needed). While networks and application 
		have long used MAC Addresses to enable end user services, the concern that this may be abused such as for 
		data monetization purposed led to the development of techniques to randomize MAC Addresses (though 
		some research disputes the efficacy of that, ref needed). </t>
	    
	    <t>MAC Address randomization is a technique similar to IPv6 temporary IIDs defined in <xref target="RFC7217"
        format="default">RFC 7217</xref>. Devices will auto-generate the MAC Address based on the device policy and use 
		    the random generated MAC Address instead of the hardware based MAC Address assigned by the manufacturer 
		    when they connect to the network. Many modern Operation Systems such as Apple iOS 
		    (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211227), Google Android 
		    (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/wifi-mac-randomization) and Microsoft Windows 10 
		    (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027925/windows-how-and-why-to-use-random-hardware-addresses) 
		    are experimenting with MAC Address randomization. The randomization policy could be time based, network 
		    based, a combination of both or involve other factors. MAC Address randomization may be one of many 
		    tactics to protect end user privacy but it can also break some network and application services that 
		    make assumptions about the persistence of MAC Address when they were designed and developed.</t>

        <t>There are perhaps some use cases in which a balance between persistence and randomization may be found. In 
		some circumstances, users may want to give a trusted network
          (e.g., home network) some predictability of the MAC Address in order to enable some
          important and valuable to end user services. This document defines a set of problem statements to continue
          the existing network and application services when MAC Addresses are randomized. These are defined by "PS" for 
		Problem Statement below:</t>

        <t>[PS-01] An Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other network operator must not make any assumption
          about the persistence of MAC Addresses.</t>
        <t>[PS-02] An ISP or other network operator must not make any assumption of the Randomization
            Policy for MAC Addresses.</t>
        <t>[PS-03] LAN policies must not depend upon a fixed, persistent MAC Address.</t>
        <t>[PS-04] A mechanism must be defined to securely identify a device.
          The mechanism can leverage existing protocols (e.g., EAP) or a newly
          defined protocol.</t>
        <t>[PS-05] ISP or other network operators, device manufacturers, and operating system developers may 
		leverage existing protocols or define a new
          mechanism to exchange information about MAC Address randomization.</t>
