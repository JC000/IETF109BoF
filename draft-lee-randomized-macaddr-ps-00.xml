   <abstract>
      <t>MAC address is the Link Layer address used in the Ethrenet protocol.
        It is usually assigned by the Network Interface Card manufacturer and being used
        for forwording and receiving frame. Due to the static nature of the
        MAC address, it raises some privacy concerns and MAC address randomization
        is being implemented. This draft documents the impacts of MAC address
        randomization to existing use cases and proposes few next steps IETF may
        consider to work on.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Ethernet protocol
        is the implementation of data link layer defined in the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI).
        Ethernet protocol is defined in IEEE 802.1 standard and MAC address is the address used in Ethernet protocol.
        MAC address is 48-bit long
        and usually defined in the hardware. Each Ethernet interface comes
        with a MAC address assigned by the manufacturer. Each device has one or more
        MAC addresses. For example, a given IoT device may only have a single WiiFi
        network interface and therefore a single MAC address. In contract, a
        laptop may have three interfaces that encompasses two wired Ethernet ports
        and a WiFi interface, and therefore will have three MAC addresses.
        MAC address is used at
        the Local-Area-Network (LAN) for frame forwarding. It is locally
        significant in the LAN and critical LAN-to-LAN
        communications.</t>

        <t>The device manufacturer typically assigns the MAC address to an interface.
        Unless the user or operating system modifies the MAC address, which is
        sometimes the case, the MAC address follows a defined format and uses 2 parts.
        Those are Manufacturer ID and Interface ID. In a typical MAC address,
        the first 3 bytes correspond to the organization that created the device,
        called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This OUI portion
        uniquely identifies a manufacturer, vendor, or other organization, and
        is assigned by the IEEE from their IEEE Registration Authority.
        The second 3 bytes of the MAC address, the Network Interface Controller
        (NIC) portion, is an identifier assigned by the manufacturer (or whatever
        organization was assigned the OUI). Because of how MAC addresses are
        constructed, a MAC address may contain information from which an
        actor/service on a local network can infer the type and/or manufacturer
        of the device, which is useful for a variety of operational and
        troubleshooting reasons. For example, a MAC address can be used to
        determine to which device on a LAN to permit or deny access at a
        particular time of day (e.g. child's tablet may not access Internet
        after 22:00 hrs until 06:00 hrs). Such services often rely on a database
        or other method to map MAC addreses to a likely device make and model,
        such as using a commercial service from Fingerbank,
        https://fingerbank.org/about/, after which the user would then label
        the device (e.g. Janeâ€™s iPhone).</t>

        <t>Many networks today
        use MAC address to uniquely identify a device. For example: Sticky DHCP
        assignment often maps to MAC address. In additional, many local network
        policies such as port-forwarding, DMZ setup and LAN QoS are all based on
        MAC address. There are also business policies that are making
        assumptions on MAC address. For example: Hospitality Internet service
        used in hotels, airplanes, and Community WiFi often uses MAC address to
        tie to Internet subscription.</t>

        <t>Major operating systems have implemented and deployed MAC address randomization
        to improve device and user privacy. It is common practice on many types of networks
        today to use the  MAC address as a form of device identification. This practice will
        break some applications and policies at the IP layer and Transport layer. We are interested
        in determining if there is sufficient support in the IETF community to define
        best practices and potentially a new protocol for service continuity in the
        presence of MAC address randomization.</t>

      <name>Problem Statement</name>

        <t>Recently, more and more privacy concerns are related to the
        static MAC address. In particular, security community worries about
        people being able to tie the MAC address to a particular device. This
        may enable device tracking and tracing. To address the privacy concern,
        MAC address randomization is developed. MAC address randomization is a
        technique similar to IPv6 temporary IIDs defined in <xref target="RFC7217"
        format="default">RFC 7217</xref>. Devices will auto-generate the MAC
        address based on the device policy and use the random generated MAC address
        instead of the hardware based MAC address assigned by the manufacturer when
        they connect to the network. Many modern Operation Systems
        such as Apple iOS (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211227),
        Google Android (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/wifi-mac-randomization)
        and Microsoft Windows 10 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027925/windows-how-and-why-to-use-random-hardware-addresses)
        are experimenting MAC addresses randomization. The randomization policy could be time based, network
        based, combination of both and more. MAC address randomization is a
        important step forward to protect user privacy. However, it will
        break some applications that make assumptions of the MAC address.</t>

        <t> In some circumstances, users may want to give the trusted network
          (e.g., home network) some predictability of the MAC address for some
          important services. For example, whitelisting MAC address for network
          access. This document defines a set of problem statements to continue
          the existing LAN services when MAC address is randomized.</t>

        <t>[PS-01] Internet Service Provider (ISP) must not make any assumption
          about the MAC address</t>
        <t>[PS-02] ISP must not make any assumption of the Randomization
            Policy</t>
        <t>[PS-03] LAN policy must not tie to a fixed MAC address</t>
        <t>[PS-04] A mechanism must be defined to securely identify a device.
          The mechanism can leverage existing protocols (e.g., EAP) or newly
          defined protocol.</t>
        <t>[PS-05] ISP and device may leverage existing protocol or define a new
          mechanism to exchange information about MAC address randomization</t>

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                     v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                     other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                     Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
v07 2020-01-21 HL    Converted the template to use XML schema version 3.
