# DRAFT Agenda for IETF-109 BoF - MADINAS

# Welcome & Agenda Review

# Background - Problem Statement & Use Cases

## Problem Definition
- Overview of OS deployment of MAC Address randomization

## Use Cases
- LAN gateway NAPT forwarding
- Static NAPR policies 
- Persistent DHCP IP address assignments
- Device-to-user or group association for malware protection
